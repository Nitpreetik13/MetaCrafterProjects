## Description
This repository serves as a collection of assignments completed throughout my learning journey. Each file is named after the specific course it pertains to, ensuring easy identification.
* [jsassessement.js](https://github.com/Nitpreetik13/MetaCrafterProjects/blob/main/jsassessement.js)
* [ethfirst.sol](https://github.com/Nitpreetik13/MetaCrafterProjects/blob/main/ethfirst.sol)
* [ethavx.sol](https://github.com/Nitpreetik13/MetaCrafterProjects/blob/main/ethavx.sol)

## Executing program
I'll delve into the execution process of these codes, outlining the steps involved. For further clarity, I've also included a Loom video showcasing the process in action.
* jsassessement.js : Get ready to explore the world of NFT creation! This section unpacks the process of creating variables to hold NFTs, defining their metadata, minting them on the blockchain, and determining the total supply. To enhance your understanding, a Loom video showcases these functionalities in action. [ðŸ”— Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/470447e3974f4d848b5821901e45d7b7?sid=2b104a4a-a7c1-47ac-afbd-5803a7bd648b)
* ethfirst.sol : Dive into the world of custom token creation with this Solidity contract! This program, compilable using Remix IDE, lets you:
  * Create your own token: Develop a unique digital asset to represent value or ownership.
  * Track balances: Keep tabs on how much of your token each address holds.
  * Manage supply: Control the minting and burning of your token to influence its availability.
  * Understand total supply: Determine the overall quantity of your token in circulation.
  * The provided Loom video delves deeper into these functionalities, offering a visual explanation. [ðŸ”— Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/fbf18e5796d6483b82bdc2fd37dcf031?sid=04f64495-814f-493d-936b-ad1244779139).
* ethavx.sol : This simplified contract verifies if the caller's address matches the contract owner's address. It utilizes three seemingly identical functions: require(), revert(), and assert(), each achieving the same purpose.
